# Voxel Terrain Generation

This voxel terrain generator is made in a similar style to the terrain seen in Minecraft.

**Made in roughly a week.**

In the future I might try and combine this with my marching squares algorithm implementation in order to create smoother terrain from a game like Astroneer. However, it's likely the project will stay like this.

There's a lot of optimisation that can be done, but I have introduced face culling and save-file size reduction in order to speed up things, although it's not very processor intensive, with the addition of water, textures and foliage it would definitely increase the number of necessary calculations.
